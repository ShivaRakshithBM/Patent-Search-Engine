Worked as the engagement manager for Carlson Analytics Lab for a client in the Law industry.

Followed the Agile Manifesto:
1) Individuals and interactions, over processes and tools
2) Working software, over comprehensive documentation
3) Customer collaboration, over contract negotiation
4) Responding to change, over following a plan

There are 3 main roles on a Scrum project:
I was the Product owner where in I maintain the Product backlog. The 2nd one is Scrum master who helps overcomes the roadblocks happening
in the project. The last one are the team members.
I used to conduct the retrospective meetings, create the user stories, maintain the task board and the burndown chart

While there is value for the items on the right, we value items on the left more

Followed the Guiding principles of Agile methodology
-- The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of working software
-- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customers competitive advantage
-- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, witha preference to the shorter time scale
-- Stakeholders and developers must collaborate on a daily basis
-- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
-- The most effective and efficient way of conveying information to and within a development team is Face-to-face/video conversation
-- A final working product is the ultimate measure of progress
-- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace 
indefinitely.
-- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
-- Simplicity—maximizing the work not done—is essential
-- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
-- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

Methodology of the Agile process:

Step 1: Set our vision with a strategy meeting
Step 2: Build out our product roadmap
For each of the goals, we included 5 key pieces of information: Date, Name, Goal, Features, and Metric. This had a loose timeline

Step 3: Got amped up with a release plan
Decided on the timelines for each of the features that is going to be released

Step 4: Time to plan out our sprints
Step 5: Keep our team on track with daily standups
--What did I do yesterday
--What am I going to do today
--What are the roadblocks that I might come across

Step 6: Review once the Sprint is over 
This is a Show and tell. A showcase of the working product to our other teams' members

Step 7: Decided what to focus on next, in our sprint retrospective
Did we do anything wrong? Any areas of improvement? What should we do in the next sprint?

Followed 2 agile methodologies:

1) Scrum
2) Kanban
--Visualized our workflow on a ‘board’
--Keep our work-in-progress (WIP) limited
--Had clear next steps
