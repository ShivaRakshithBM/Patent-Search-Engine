Worked as the engagement manager for Carlson Analytics Lab for a client in the Law industry.

Followed the Agile Manifesto:
1) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2) Working software over comprehensive documentation
3) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4) Responding to change over following a plan

Followed the Guiding principles of Agile methodology
-- The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
-- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
-- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months
-- Stakeholders and developers must collaborate on a daily basis
-- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
-- Face-to-face meetings are deemed the most efficient and effective format for project success
-- A final working product is the ultimate measure of progress
-- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
-- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
-- Simplicity—maximizing the work not done—is an essential element
-- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
-- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

Step 1: Set your vision with a strategy meeting
Step 2: Build out your product roadmap
For each of these goals, you want to include 5 key pieces of information: Date, Name, Goal, Features, and Metric. This will have a loose timeline

Step 3: Get amped up with a release plan
Decided on the timelines for each of the features that is going to be released

Step 4: It’s time to plan out your sprints
Step 5: Keep your team on track with daily standups
--What did you do yesterday
--What are you going to do today
--What are the roadblocks that you might come across

Step 6: Sprint’s done? It’s time for a review 
This is a Show and tell. A showcase of the working product to your other team members

Step 7: What’s next? Decide what to focus on in your sprint retrospective
Did we do anything wrong? Any areas of improvement? What should we do in the next sprint?

Followed 2 agile methodologies:

1) Scrum
2) Kanban
--Visualize your workflow on a ‘board’
--Keep your work-in-progress (WIP) limited
--Have clear next steps
